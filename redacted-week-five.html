                    <p class="date"></p>
                    <p>This week was… intense. I started building the banquet scene properly, the first real puzzle scene in our game, and it was the first time I felt the full weight of designing a complex 2D-first-person scene in Unity. I knew it would be tricky, but I did not know it would chew me up and spit me out like this.</p>

                    <p><strong>Let’s talk about layering.</strong> I had this vision of building a 2.5D parallax-style scene using world space canvases and layers of 960x405 PNGs that scrolled as the player moved the camera left and right. Simple enough in theory. I had all the assets, built a beautiful stack of panels—foreground elements, midground dancers, chandeliers, and sparkles—each perfectly composed in Photoshop.</p>

                    <p>And then I tried to make a button clickable. Nothing happened.</p>

                    <p>I assumed the script was broken. I checked the canvas, the event system, the raycasters, even the layers—everything looked fine. Unity said there were no errors. So why couldn’t I click the button sitting on top of the chandelier? I lost a solid two days spiraling over this before I had a 3am revelation after collapsing mid-debug:</p>

                    <p><em>All of my PNGs were full-sized 960x405 images.</em> Even though only part of the image was “visible,” the rest of the transparent canvas was still blocking interactions below it.</p>

                    <p>So, yeah. All those lovely dancers? Blocking the button. The floating centerpiece? Blocking the mini-game. The literal sparkles? Blocking my sanity.</p>

                    <p>To fix this, I cropped every single screw and object to the size of their visible area and reimported all of them. I also restructured the entire hierarchy: separated all interactable objects into a dedicated “UI_Interactables” layer sitting above the decor, and made sure every UI element with a collider had Raycast Target enabled and a graphic raycaster on the canvas. Only then—only then—did things start to behave.</p>

                    <h3>Successes this week:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Got horizontal camera movement working using input axes and clamped boundaries.</li>
                      <li>Implemented parallax scrolling between three layers.</li>
                      <li>Added an interactable button to launch the chandelier mini-game.</li>
                      <li>Realized I need to crop everything manually and not trust transparent PNGs ever again.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Things that drove me to madness:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Unity’s lack of error messages for UI layering conflicts.</li>
                      <li>Buttons being hidden behind "invisible" images.</li>
                      <li>Realizing halfway through testing that I had three EventSystems active. (Oops.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Takeaway of the week:</h3>
                    <p><em>Just because something looks layered properly doesn’t mean Unity knows it’s layered properly.</em> Visual hierarchy ≠ interaction hierarchy. And if something’s not clickable? Check your raycasters. Check your canvas. Check your cropped assets. Then cry and try again.</p>
