									<P>Welcome to the first entry of my dev diary for [redacted]! Buckle up because this week was A LOT. If I had to sum it up in one word? Overwhelming. But also kinda exciting? Maybe. Let's break it down.</P>
									<p>
										<h2>The Idea Phase: "We Have Too Many Thoughts, Help."</h2>
										We started with the simple task of coming up with a game concept. Which, in theory, sounds easy. In practice? Absolute madness. Our group had so many ideas flying around—AI, history, politics, magic, secret societies, puzzles, narrative twists... it was like a brainstorm tornado. At one point, it felt like we were trying to cram three different games into one.
										After a lot of back and forth (and me just sitting there trying to process it all), we landed on something: a mystery-adventure game set in a world where history is being erased. The player, an ex-member of a rogue historian group, is trapped in a tower filled with "forbidden artifacts"—including a magical paintbrush that lets you restore lost memories. Oh, and there’s a creepy omniscient narrator watching your every move. No big deal.
										Did we finalize all the mechanics? Nope. Did we have a working prototype? Absolutely not. But we had an idea, and that was something.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2> Engine Dilemma: "Unity? Godot? Unreal? HELP."</h2>
										Next up: choosing a game engine. Cue the collective suffering.
										Some of us wanted Unity, some were curious about Unreal Engine, and I (foolishly) suggested Godot because its interface looked clean and simple. Spoiler alert: We went in circles for DAYS trying to decide.
										I even downloaded both Unity and Godot and tried messing around with them. Godot felt really lightweight, but Unity had more resources and tutorials available. So after all that debate, we settled on Godot... for like, a week.
										Then, in classic chaotic team fashion, we pulled a full UNO reverse and switched back to Unity.
										Yes, I cried (internally). Yes, I now have two engines installed that I barely understand. Yes, I am in tutorial hell.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>Learning Unity: "What Are Buttons. What Is Code. I Am Lost."</h2>
										After committing to Unity, I had to actually learn how to use it.
										I started with the basics: opening Unity, clicking around, pretending I knew what I was doing. Then I did some Unity Learn tutorials and set up a test project. It went something like this:
										<ol>
											<li>Open Unity.</li>
											<li>Get overwhelmed by all the buttons.</li>
											<li>Panic.</li>
											<li>Close Unity.</li>
											<li>Try again.</li>
											<li>Accidentally break something.</li>
											<li>Google how to fix it.</li>
											<li>Repeat forever.</li>
										</ol>
										It was a struggle. But after a few days, I started getting the hang of the interface (kind of). I learned about GameObjects, scenes, prefabs, and even wrote some baby C# scripts that actually worked!! Progress!!
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>Crashouts & Burnouts: "Sleep? I Don’t Know Her."</h2>
										This week drained me.
										<br>
										Between brainstorming, switching engines, and forcing my brain to absorb Unity, I hit several mental walls. I kept pushing myself late into the night, thinking, "Just one more tutorial," only to wake up feeling like a zombie the next day.
										I had moments where I just stared at my screen with zero thoughts, moments where I felt like I wasn’t contributing enough, and moments where I questioned if I could actually pull this off.
										But I kept reminding myself: this is a learning experience. I’m not supposed to know everything right away. It’s okay to struggle, to take breaks, to crash out and come back later.
										So I did. And honestly? I think I needed that.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>Takeaways: "We’re Gonna Make It... I Think."</h2>
										Looking back, Week 1 was a mess, but it was also a foundation. We had an idea. We chose an engine (eventually). And we started learning.
										<br>
										<h4>What I Learned:</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>Game development is HARD.</li> 
											<li>Unity has too many buttons.</li>
											<li>Godot is cool but not for this project.</li>
											<li>Switching engines mid-week is actual pain.</li>
											<li>I need to take breaks before my brain melts.</li>
										</ol>
										<h4>Goals for Next Week:</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>Get a basic Unity prototype running (even if it’s ugly).</li> 
											<li>Work on storyboarding and puzzle mechanics.</li> 
											<li>Sleep more than 4 hours a night (please).</li>
										</ol>
										<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4> 
										I have no idea how this project will turn out, but hey, we survived Week 1. 
										<br>
										Here’s to more chaos in Week 2!
