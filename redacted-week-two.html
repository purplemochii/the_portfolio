                                        I think this week can be summed up in two words: Unity. Again.
                                        <br>
                                        So, after spending time getting comfy with Godot, our team decided—plot twist!
                                        —to go back to Unity. Why? Well, despite Godot’s cute minimalism, we realized that 
                                        Unity just has way more tutorials and resources that we might desperately need when 
                                        things go sideways (which they definitely will).
                                    </p>

                                        <h2>The Great Unity Migration™</h2>
                                        Moving everything back to Unity wasn’t exactly smooth. I had to reinstall everything (which, of course, took ages),
                                         make sure my Unity Hub wasn’t being weird, and reconfigure settings. It was basically a tech scavenger hunt but with extra frustration.
                                        Not to mention, Unity’s interface felt weirdly overwhelming after getting used to Godot’s neat layout. 
                                        It’s like when you move your furniture around and suddenly keep bumping into everything. 
                                        But hey, at least we finally made a decision… right?
                                    </p>

                                        <h2>Game Progress? Kinda.</h2> 
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>We finalized that the game is a 2D first-person story game, and we want it to play with perspective and lighting for that almost-3D illusion.</li>
                                        <li>Our concept is slowly solidifying, though we’re still arguing about some mechanics.</li>
                                        <li>I spent a ridiculous amount of time looking at puzzles we could use in the game, only to end up in a deep rabbit hole of cryptography and ARGs.</li>
                                        <li>I also realized I should probably start writing the game’s story properly instead of just keeping all the ideas in my brain.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                        <h2>Crashouts & Chaos</h2>                                       
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>My sleep schedule? Gone.</li>
                                            <li>My focus? Also gone.</li>
                                            <li>My ability to keep up with everything? Haha.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>One night, I fully intended to “work on the game,” but I somehow ended up watching game theory videos at 3 AM instead. Oops.
                                        <br>Unity kept giving me errors I had never seen before in my life. I think I threatened to uninstall it at least twice.

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Unity is still kinda scary. I need to take it slow and actually follow tutorials instead of trying to brute-force my way through everything.</li>
                                            <li>Game mechanics take longer to figure out than expected. Just because an idea sounds cool doesn’t mean it’ll work smoothly.</li>
                                            <li>I need to manage my time better. Random late-night deep dives are fun, but I actually need to get things done.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <h2>Goals for Next Week</h2>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Start prototyping basic gameplay mechanics in Unity (even if it's just moving around).</li>
                                            <li>Flesh out the story beats properly so we have a clearer structure.</li>
                                            <li>Stop falling into endless research loops and actually make decisions on puzzles.</li>
                                            <li>Try to fix my sleep schedule (probably a lost cause, but worth a shot).</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                                        This week was mostly about readjusting to Unity and refining our ideas. 
                                        I wouldn’t say we made huge progress, but at least we now know what we’re doing (…sort of). 
                                        I need to actually code things next week, or I might explode from feeling unproductive.
                                        <br>Until then, I shall embrace the chaos.
                                    </p>
