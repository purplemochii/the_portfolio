                                    <p>If I had to title this week like a documentary, it’d be <em>“Everything, Everywhere, Crashing All At Once.”</em></p>

                                    <h2>☠️ The Scene of the Crime</h2>
                                    <p>It was the day before submission. I was finally feeling like I’d made peace with everything in the game — the clunky mini-games, the beautiful but cursed dialogue system, the bugs that I’d MacGyver’d into behaving. I opened Unity like I had a thousand times before.</p>
                                    <p>And then it happened. The project broke.</p>
                                    <p>All of the scenes — gone. Not a corruption warning. Not a recoverable autosave. Just gone. One moment they were there. The next, I was staring into the digital void.</p>
                                    <p>I tried reloading. Rebuilding the library. Shutting down. Restarting. Nothing.</p>

                                    <h2>💀 The Collapse</h2>
                                    <p>I just... sat there. In the bathroom. Crying. I hadn’t cried in months. Not from burnout, not from university stress, not even from when I spilled tea on my notes that one time. But this? This took me out.</p>
                                    <p>All that time. All the little polish moments. The dialogue choices I was so proud of. My camera scripts. My sparkles. My cursed screws. My radiant red progress bar. <strong>Gone.</strong></p>
                                    <p>For about fifteen minutes, I was ready to just submit a .zip folder with a screenshot and an apology note.</p>

                                    <h2>🔁 The Comeback</h2>
                                    <p>And then I got back up. Cloned the repo again. And again. And again. Third clone’s the charm, apparently, because eventually a version of the project — slightly outdated but salvageable — was sitting on my desktop.</p>
                                    <p>Unity screamed at me. Half the prefabs were missing. Some of the polish I’d added just days before was MIA. Banquet dialogue timing was broken again. The credits scene was basically a haunted placeholder. But I rebuilt what I could. Cleaned it up. Made it work.</p>

                                    <h2>💻 Command Line Hero</h2>
                                    <p>Once the game was (kind of?) working, the final challenge arrived: uploading to itch.io.</p>
                                    <p>We were supposed to use Butler. It sounded easy. It was not.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Windows?</strong> Refused to cooperate. Half the team tried it. We got every possible “path not found” and “file permission denied” error known to mankind. Nothing worked.</p>
                                    <p>So I pulled out my dusty old Linux laptop, whispered a little prayer, opened a terminal window, and ran the exact same command that had failed on every other machine.</p>
                                    <p>And it worked.</p>
                                    <p>I hosted the game. I did the final build, zipped it, deployed it, and now our weird, glitchy, heartfelt baby of a game lives on itch.io — where people can actually play it.</p>

                                    <h2>💔 Not Perfect, But Ours</h2>
                                    <p>No, the final build wasn’t what I had planned. A lot of scenes didn’t make it in. Some dialogues were still too fast. I lost a lot of polish and a few features I had quietly grown really proud of.</p>
                                    <p>But despite everything, I made it to the end.</p>
                                    <p><strong>I’m still making it to the end.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Even if the rest of the team moves on — and that’s okay! — I’m going to keep working on this game over the summer. Add more polish. More puzzles. More of that juicy glitchy lore. Because even through all the crashes and chaos, I genuinely love the world we created.</p>
                                    <p>This isn't just a coursework project to me anymore. <strong>It's mine.</strong></p>
                                    <p>And I want to see it finished.</p>
