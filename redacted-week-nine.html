                                    <p>If Week 8 was the glitter and screw disaster, Week 9 was the week Unity looked at my canvas setup and said: "No ‚ù§Ô∏è"</p>

                                    <h2>üé≠ UI Overlay Scene: My New Best Frenemy</h2>
                                    <p>This was the week I fully committed to the UI_Overlay scene, which was supposed to be my solution to‚Ä¶ well, everything. It housed the dialogue system, objective pop-ups, and that regal little crimson progress bar. The idea was: make it once, prefab it, and drop it into every scene like a good little modular dev.</p>
                                    <p>Sounds clean, right? It was not.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>UI panels were invisible in scene view half the time.</li>
                                        <li>World space scaling is a JOKE. Resize one thing and suddenly your buttons are thumbnail-sized or the size of the Empire State Building.</li>
                                        <li>I had to write a script that made the canvas automatically show/hide based on the scene and dialogue state because otherwise it would just sit there silently judging me.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>üß† Mini-Game Layering: Overlays on Overlays on Overlays</h2>
                                    <p>I had this really specific vision: when a mini-game starts, the background dims and the mini-game elements show up on top of the current scene, no scene loading, no cuts. Just a fade in. Elegant, immersive. Very <em>Slay the Princess</em> meets <em>Inception</em>.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Getting the blur shader to work with the world space canvas took three separate attempts. I eventually gave up and faked it with a semi-transparent black overlay. Not the same, but hey, at least it didn‚Äôt crash Unity.</li>
                                        <li>Trying to layer UI elements in the right order is like playing Jenga. You move one thing and everything else collapses.</li>
                                        <li>I also had to find a way to pause certain parts of the scene logic (like camera movement) when a mini-game was up, and unpause them cleanly after. Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm now deeply intimate with <code>SetActive(false)</code> and <code>Time.timeScale</code>.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>‚úçÔ∏è The Painting Mechanic That Refused to Behave</h2>
                                    <p>So one of the banquet puzzles involved ‚Äúpainting in‚Äù a blacked-out character using the player‚Äôs cursor. We faked it by having the black sprite swap to the full-colored one once the player ‚Äúpainted enough.‚Äù It worked‚Ä¶ eventually.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>First issue: cursor clicks weren‚Äôt being detected because the blacked-out maid had no collider.</li>
                                        <li>Second issue: adding a collider broke the sparkles because apparently the collider was blocking the FX layer.</li>
                                        <li>Third issue: the blacked-out sprite refused to go away even after being replaced. Turns out I was just disabling the wrong GameObject. Classic.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>I also gave up trying to track how much of the maid had been painted and just made it so one good swoosh = complete. Nobody tell the real artists.</p>

                                    <h2>üí¨ Dialogue System V2: The Glow-Up</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Typewriter effect? ‚úÖ</li>
                                        <li>Character name fade-ins? ‚úÖ</li>
                                        <li>Choice buttons on the side? ‚úÖ</li>
                                        <li>Objective text that disappears after a few seconds? ‚úÖ</li>
                                        <li>Fully script-driven flow so I can hardcode lines per scene? ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It was one of those rare ‚Äúoh wait this actually works and looks good‚Äù moments. Possibly the only thing this week that didn‚Äôt try to fight me.</p>

                                    <h2>üòµ‚Äçüí´ Burnout Watch</h2>
                                    <p>The candle is officially being burned at both ends with a blowtorch. I am sleeping maybe 4 hours a night and waking up with bug reports from my subconscious. I had a dream where Unity sent me a cease and desist because my UI was ‚Äúoffensive.‚Äù The dev brain rot is so real.</p>

                                    <p>But even through the breakdowns, I started seeing things click into place. A working dialogue system, functional puzzles, and real player flow. The game‚Äôs not done, but it‚Äôs alive now.</p>
                                    <p>Up next: Week 10, which I like to call "The Week of the Banquet Cutscene Massacre‚Ñ¢." You ready? üò§</p>
