                                    <p>I’m combining these two weeks because — let’s be real — midterms hit like a truck and I barely opened Unity except to check if my buttons still clicked. (They didn’t. Of course.)</p>

                                    <h2>🧠 Brainstorming in the Background</h2>
                                    <p>Even though my actual development slowed to a crawl, my brain didn’t stop running laps. I found myself sketching scene layouts during lectures, mapping out puzzle logic on the back of flashcards, and trying to mentally untangle our game’s act structure during library breaks.</p>
                                    <p>I also made a mood board in Notion (read: I dumped like 40 screenshots of <em>Slay the Princess</em> and creepy tower architecture into a page and called it research). Visual vibes are solid. Execution? TBD.</p>

                                    <h2>📉 Development Lull = Design Recovery</h2>
                                    <p>This wasn’t a totally wasted stretch, though. I started to seriously re-evaluate our UI structure — especially how we were handling dialogue and transitions. I’d been hardcoding too much, and it was becoming unsustainable. These weeks helped me realize I needed to rebuild it more modularly — and after midterms, that’s exactly what I started doing.</p>

                                    <h2>😮‍💨 Real Talk: Burnout Warning Signs</h2>
                                    <p>Midway through Week 7 I hit a classic student-dev wall. I was mentally exhausted, juggling research deadlines with group projects, and struggling with the guilt of not doing more. But weirdly? That pause helped. I was able to come back with clearer eyes and better structure the chaos that was to come in Week 8.</p>

                                    <h2>📝 What Worked:</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Sketching puzzles while pretending to study for midterms</li>
                                        <li>Building visual tone boards for future scenes</li>
                                        <li>Reimagining the dialogue manager in theory before rebuilding it in practice</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>💥 What Didn’t:</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Unity. I barely opened it.</li>
                                        <li>Time management. Cramming and devving are mortal enemies.</li>
                                        <li>Sleep. Let’s just say I owe myself 12 naps.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Next up: the glittery collapse that was Week 8, where I learned that particles are not to be trusted and nothing — <strong>nothing</strong> — is ever layered the way you think it is.</p>
